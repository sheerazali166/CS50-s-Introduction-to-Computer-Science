# Program 20

print("------------------Program 20------------------")


# To further our understanding of loops and iteration in Python, letâ€™s create a new file called uppercase.py
# as follows:

# Uppercases string one character at a time
# before = input("Before: ")
# print("After: ", end="")

# for c in before:
    # print(c.upper(), end="")

# print()


# Notice how end= is used to pass a parameter to the print function that continues the line without a line ending.
# This code passes one string at a time.


# Program 21

print("------------------Program 21------------------")


# Reading the documentation, we discover that Python has methods that can be implemented upon the entire string
# as follows:

# Uppercases string all at once
beforeTwo = input("Before: ")

after = beforeTwo.upper()
print(f"After: {after}")
