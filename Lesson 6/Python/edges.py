# Finds edges in an images

from PIL import Image, ImageFilter

# Find edges
before = Image.open("bridge.bmp")
after = before.filter(ImageFilter.FIND_EDGES)
after.save("out_two.bmp")


# Notice that this code is a small adjustment to your blur code, but produces a dramatically different result.

# Find faces in picture
