# To illustrate this simplicity, let’s type ‘code dictionary.py’ in the terminal window and write code as follows:

# Words in dictionary
words = set()

def check(word):
    """Return true if word is in dictionary else false"""
    return word.lower() in words

def load(dictionary):
    """Load dictionary into memory, returning true if successful else false"""
    with open(dictionary) as file:
        words.update(file.read().splitlines())
    return True

def size():
    """Returns number of words in dictionary if loaded else 0 if not yet loaded"""
    return len(words)

def unload():
    """Unloads dictonary from memory, returning true if successful else false"""
    return True

# Notice that there are four functions above. In the check function, if a word is in words, it returns True. So much
# easier than an implementation in C! Similarly, in the load function the dictionary file is opened. For each line in
# that file, we add that line to words. Using rstrip, the trailing new line is removed from the added word. size simply
# returns the len or length of words. unload only needs to return True because Python handles memory management
# on its own.

# The above code illustrates why higher-level languages exist: To simplify and allow you to write code more easily.
# However, speed is a tradeoff. Because C allows you, the programmer, to make decisions about memory management, it may
# run faster than Python

# – depending on your code. While C only runs your lines of code, Python runs all the code that comes under the hood
# with it when you call Python’s built-in functions.

# You can learn more about functions in the Python documentation
