        <!--
        
            Welcome!

                In previous weeks, we introduced you to Python, a high-level programming language that utilized the same  building blocks we learned in C. Today,
                we will extend those building blocks further in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                
                The internet is a technology that we all use

                Using our skills from previous weeks, we can build our own web pages and applications.

                The ARPANET connected the first points on the internet to one another.
                Dots between two points could be considered routers.

                Routers

                To route data from one place to another, we need to make routing decisions. That is, someone needs to program how data is transferred from point
                A to point B.
                
                You can imagine how data could take multiple paths from point A and point B, such that when a router is congested, data can flow through another
                path. Packets of data are transferred from one router to another, from one computer to another.
                
                TCP/IP are two protocols that allow computers to transfer data between them over the internet.

                IP or internet protocol is a way by which computers can identify one another across the internet. Every computer has a unique address in the world.
                Addresses are in this form:

                #.#.#.#

                Numbers range from 0 to 255. IP addresses are 32-bits, meaning that these addresses could accommodate over 4 billion addresses. Newer versions of IP
                addresse, implementing 128-bits, can accommodate far more computers!
                
                In the real world, servers do a lot of work for us.

                Packets are structured as follows:


                                0                   1                   2                   3
                                0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

                Packets are standardized. The source and destination are held within each packet.                            

                TCP, or transmission control protocol, is used to distinguish web services from one another. For example, 80 is used to denote HTTP and 443
                is used to denote HTTPS. These numbers are port numbers.

                When information is sent from one location to another, a source IP address, a destination IP address, and TCP port number are sent.

                These protocols are also used to fragment large files into multiple parts or packets. For example, a large photo of a cat can be sent
                in multiple packets. When a packet is lost, TCP/IP can request missing packets again from the origin server.

                TCP will acknowledge when all the data has been transmitted and received.


                DNS

                    It would be very tedious if you needed to remember an IP address to visit a website.

                    DNS, or domain name systems, is a collection of servers on the internet that are used to route website addresses like harvard.edu
                    to a specific IP address.

                    DNS simply hold a table or database that links specific, fully qualified domain names to specific IP addresses.


                HTTP
                
                    HTTP or hypertext transfer protocol is an application-level protocol that developers use to build powerful and useful things through
                    the transferring of data from one place to another.

                    When you see an address such as https://www.example.com you are actually implicitly visiting that address with a / at the end of it.

                    The path is what exists after that slash. For example, https://www.example.com/folder/file.html visits example.com and browses to the
                    folder folder and then visits the file named file.html.

                    The .com is called a top-level domain that is used to denote the location or type of organization associated with this address.

                    https in this address is the protocol that is used to connect to that web address. By protocol, we mean that HTTP utilizes GET
                    or POST requests to ask for information from a server. For example, you can launch Google Chrome, right-click, and click inspect.
                    When you open the developer tools and visit Network, selecting Preserve log, you will see Request Headers. You’ll see mentions of
                    GET. This is possible in other browsers as well, using slightly different methods.

                    For example, when issuing a GET request, your computer may send the following to a server:

                        GET / HTTP/2
                        Host: www.harvard.edu


                    Notice that this requests via HTTP the content served on www.harvard.edu     

                    Generally, after making a request a server, you will receive the following in Response Headers:


                    HTTP/2 200
                
                    Content-Type: text/html

                    This approach to inspecting these logs may be a bit more complicated than need be. You can analyze the work of HTTP protocols
                    at cs50.dev. For example, type the following in your terminal window:


                    curl -I https://www.harvard.edu/


                    Notice that the output of this command returns all the header values of the responses of the server.

                    Via developer tools in your web browser, you can see all the HTTP requests when browsing to the above website.

                    Further, execute the following command in your terminal window:

                    curl -I https://harvard.edu


                    Notice that you will see a 301 response, providing a hint to a browser of where it can find the correct website.

                    Similarly, execute the following in your terminal window:

                    curl -I http://www.harvard.edu/

                    Notice that the s in https has been removed. The server response will show that the response is 301, meaning that the website has
                    permanently moved.

                    Similar to 301, a code of 404 means that a specified URL has not been found. There are numerous other response codes, such as:


                            200 OK
                            301 Moved Permanently
                            302 Found
                            304 Not Modified
                            304 Temporary Redirect
                            401 Unauthorized
                            403 Forbidden
                            404 Not Found
                            418 I'm a Teapot
                            500 Internal Server Error
                            503 Service Unavailable

                    It’s worth mentioning that 500 errors are always your fault as the developer. This will be especially important for next week’s problem
                    set, and potentially for your final project!    

                HTML

                    HTML or hypertext markup language is made up of tags, each of which may have some attributes that describe it.
                    
                    In your terminal, type code hello.html and write code as follows:

     -->

    hello, body

    
    
        <!-- 
        
            Notice that the html tag both opens and closes this file. Further, notice the lang attribute, which modifies the behavior of the html tag.
            Also, notice that there are both head tags and body tags. Indentation is not required but does suggest a hierarchy.
        
            You can serve your code by typing http-server. This serve is now available on a very long URL. If you click it, you can visit the website with
            your own code.

            When you visit this URL, notice that the file name hello.html appears at the end of this URL. Further, notice, based upon the URL, that the server
            is serving via port 8080.

            The hierarchy of tags can be represented as follows:


                                                                                            ----------------------------

                                                                                            (          document            ) 
                                                                                            (                              ) 
                                                                                            ----------------------------
