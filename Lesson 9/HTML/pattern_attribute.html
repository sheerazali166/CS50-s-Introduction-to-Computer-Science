    <!-- While the browser uses these built-in attributes to check for an email address, we can add a pattern attribute to ensure that only specifi
    data ends up in the email address: -->

    <form>
        <input autocomplete="off" autofocus name="email" pattern=".+@.+\.edu" placeholder="Email" type="email">
        <button>Register</button>
    </form>

    <!-- Notice that the pattern attribute is handed a regular expression to denote that the email address must include an @ symbol and a .edu. -->
    <!-- You can learn more about regular expressions from Mozillaâ€™s documentation. Further, you can make inquiries to cs50.ai for hints. -->
