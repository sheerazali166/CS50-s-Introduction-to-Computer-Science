            Regular expressions or regexes are a means by which to ensure that user-provided data fits a specific format. 
            We can impelement our own registration page that utilizes regexes as follows: -->

    <form>
        <input autocomplete="off" autofocus name="email" placeholder="Email" type="email">
        <button>Register</button>
    </form>            

    <!-- Notice that the input tag includes attributes that designate that this is of type email. The browser knows to double-check
    that input is an email address. -->
