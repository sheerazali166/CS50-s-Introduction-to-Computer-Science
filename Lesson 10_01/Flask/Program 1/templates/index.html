    Welcome!

        In previous weeks, you have learned numerous programming languages, techniques, and strategies.
        Indeed, this class has been far less of a C class or Python class and far more of a programming class, such
        that you can go on to follow future trends.

        In these past several weeks, you have learned how to learn about programming.

        Today, we will be moving from HTML and CSS into combining HTML, CSS, SQL, Python, and JavaScript so you can
        create your own web applications.

    Static to Dynamic

        Up until this point, all HTML you saw was pre-written and static.
        In the past, when you visited a page, the browser downloaded an HTML page, and you were able to view it. These
        are considered static pages, in that what programmed in the HTML is exactly what the user sees and downloads
        to their internet browser.

        Dynamic pages refer to the ability of Python and similar languages to create HTML files on-the-fly.
        Accordingly, you can have web pages that are generated by options selected by your user.

        You have used http-server in the past to serve your web pages. Today, we are going to utilize a new server that
        can parse out a web address and perform actions based on the URL provided.

        Flask

            Flask is a third-party library that allows you to host web applications using the Flask framework, or a
            micro-framework, within Python.
            You can run flask by executing flask run in your terminal window in cs50.dev.
            To do so, you will need a file called app.py and a folder called templates.
            To get started, create a folder called templates and create a file called index.html with the
            following code:

    -->

    hello, {{ name }}
