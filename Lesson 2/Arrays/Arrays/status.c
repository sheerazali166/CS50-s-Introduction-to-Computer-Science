    // When a program ends, a special exit code is provided to the computer.
    
    // When a program exits without error, a status code of 0 is provided the computer. Often, when an error occurs that
    // results in the program ending, a status of 1 is provided by the computer.
    
    // You could write a program as follows that illustrates this by typing code status.c and writing code as follows:

    // Notice that if you fail to provide ./status David, you will get an exit status of 1. However, if you do provide
    // ./status David, you will get an exit status of 0.
     
    // You can imagine how you might use portions of the above program to check if a user provided the correct number of

    // Cryptography
    
    // Cryptography is the art of ciphering and deciphering a message.
    // plaintext and a key are provided to a cipher, resulting in ciphered text.
    
    // The key is a special argument passed to the cipher along with the plaintext. The cipher uses the key to make decisions
    // about how to implement its cipher algorithm.

    // How to utilize arrays within your code.
